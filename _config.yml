          The continuation of the DBMS course project will be launched at the Christmas market.
          CeranaPOS is a simple, convenient and fast online POS service. Do you set up a stall in a small market or do some short-term transactions, but find that the invoicing system on the market is expensive and unnecessary? Purchase, sales, profit management, employee management, all you need is a laptop or tablet to easily meet your needs!
